# No Diplomatic Penalty for "Too Many Trade Partners"
A mod for Total War Warhammer III. By default, the game allows you only 3 trade agreements (plus an additional 0.2 per owned region) before you start incurring a penalty with the negotiating partner (-3 per additional trade agreement over the limit). This is pretty limiting to Kislev and Cathay especially, who from a logic and lore perspective should have a lot of trade going on with other Order factions like the Empire and the Dwarfs.

This mod sets the base number of non-penalised trade agreements to 50 (+ 5 per region), and sets the penalty to 0. Happy trading!

My other diplomacy mod that you may be interested in - [No Strategic Threat Diplomatic Penalty](https://github.com/DrDCB/TWWH3_No_Strategic_Threat_Diplomatic_Penalty) AKA the "No Great Power Penalty" equivalent mod.

IMMORTAL EMPIRES UPDATE NOTICE:
The table used in this mod has seen a significant change with patch 2.0/IE. The updated mod appears to be working as intended based on a cursory test, but it's probable CA made additional changes elsewhere to the diplomacy system. I don't know what this might mean for compatibility with other diplomacy mods. As such, consider this a BETA for the time being until I have had sufficient time to test and investigate. Use at your own risk.
